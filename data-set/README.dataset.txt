This dataset contains annotated pictures of animals (like wild pigs and deer) from trail cameras in East Texas.

You can use this dataset and the detection API to create computer vision applications for hunting, monitoring animal population health, counting deer sightings, and more!

Automatically filter through hours of trail cam footage to find the times/frames when wild game is caught on camera.
